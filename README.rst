  A declarative language for building modern applications.

Idea
----

  The idea is to write example applications with increasing complexity, along with a compiler to compile those apps.

ToDo
----

* Write an MVP.

Notes
-----

* Though the compiler is written in python, the goal is to allow for the builders to be written in any language. The plan is to build a master structure and pass it to builders. From then on the control is transferred to builders.
